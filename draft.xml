A GeoJSON object may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features.  </t><t>GeoJSON supports the following seven geometry types: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>Point </t><t>LineString </t><t>Polygon </t><t>MultiPoint </t><t>MultiLineString </t><t>MultiPolygon </t><t>GeometryCollection </t></list></t><t>GeoJSON also comprises the types: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>Feature </t><t>FeatureCollection </t></list></t><t>Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and a FeatureCollection contains an array of features.  </t><t>A complete GeoJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON terms). In GeoJSON, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs -- also called members. For each member, the name is always a string. Member values are either a string, number, object, array or one of the JSON literals: true, false, and null.  An array consists of elements where each element is a value as described above.  </t><section title="Conventions Used in This Document" anchor="conventions-used-in-this-document" toc="default"><t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  </t><t>The ordering of the members of any JSON object defined in this document MUST be considered irrelevant, as specified by [RFC4627].  </t><t>The ordering of the elements of any JSON array defined in this document MUST at least follow a stable ordering unless the specific object's type it is a member of defines an absolute ordering, which then takes precedence.  </t><t>Some examples use the combination of a JavaScript single line comment (//) followed by an ellipsis (...) as placeholder notation for content deemed irrelevant by the authors and at that point.  These placeholders must of course be deleted or otherwise replaced, before attempting to validate the corresponding JSON code example.  </t></section><section title="Definitions" anchor="definitions" toc="default"><t><list style="symbols"><t>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and the terms object, name, value, array, number, true, false, and null are to be interpreted as defined in [RFC4627].  </t><t>Inside this document the term geometry types refers to the seven case-sensitive strings: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", and "GeometryCollection".  </t><t>As another shorthand notation the term GeoJSON types refers to the nine case-senisitve strings "Feature", "FeatureCollection" and those considered geometry types.  </t><t>A hole is considered, for the sake of illustration, as simply a geometric shape that is to be excluded from the geometric shape in which it appears.  </t><t>When using the term interior geometric shape it is assumed that there exists an exterior shape.  </t></list></t></section><section title="Example" anchor="example" toc="default"><t>A GeoJSON feature collection: </t><figure title="" suppress-title="false" align="left" alt="" width="" height=""><artwork xml:space="preserve" name="" type="" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">

This member's value is a case-sensitive string that determines the type of the GeoJSON object by being one of GeoJSON types. If - depending on this value - additional rules apply, then these are stated in the following sections where each type is further defined.  </t><t>A GeoJSON object MAY have a "bbox" member. If it is present, the value of it MUST be a bounding box array (see "3.  Bounding Box").  </t></list></t><section title="Geometry Object" anchor="geometry-object" toc="default"><t>A geometry is a GeoJSON object where the type member's value is a geometry type.  </t><t>A GeoJSON geometry object of any type other than "GeometryCollection" MUST have a member with the name "coordinates". The value of the coordinates member is always an array. The structure for the elements in this array is determined by the type of geometry.  </t><section title="Position" anchor="position" toc="default"><t>A position is the fundamental geometry construct. The "coordinates" member of a geometry object is composed of either: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>one position (in the case of a Point geometry), </t><t>an array of positions (LineString or MultiPoint geometries), </t><t>an array of arrays of positions (Polygons, MultiLineStrings), </t><t>or a multidimensional array of positions (MultiPolygon).  </t></list></t><t>A position is represented by an array of numbers. There MUST be two or more elements. In general the first two elements will be World Geodetic System (WGS 84) longitude and latitude, precisely in that order, and a third (optionally) will be altitude in meters.  </t><t>Any number of additional elements are allowed -- interpretation and meaning of additional elements is beyond the scope of this specification.  </t><t>Examples of positions and geometries are provided in "Appendix A. Geometry Examples".  </t></section><section title="Point" anchor="point" toc="default"><t>For type "Point", the "coordinates" member MUST be a single position.  </t></section><section title="MultiPoint" anchor="multipoint" toc="default"><t>For type "MultiPoint", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of positions.  </t></section><section title="LineString" anchor="linestring" toc="default"><t>For type "LineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of two or more positions.  </t></section><section title="MultiLineString" anchor="multilinestring" toc="default"><t>For type "MultiLineString", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of LineString coordinate arrays.  </t></section><section title="Polygon" anchor="polygon" toc="default"><t>To specify a constraint specific to polygons, it is useful to introduce the concept of a linear ring (LinearRing): </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>A LinearRing is a closed LineString with 4 or more positions.  </t><t>The first and last positions are equivalent (they represent equivalent points).  </t></list></t><t>This leads to a canonical formulation of the Polygon geometry type definition as follows: </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>For type "Polygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of LinearRing coordinate arrays.  </t><t>For Polygons with more than one of these rings, the first MUST be the exterior ring and any others MUST be interior rings or holes.  </t></list></t></section><section title="MultiPolygon" anchor="multipolygon" toc="default"><t>For type "MultiPolygon", the "coordinates" member MUST be an array of Polygon coordinate arrays.  </t></section><section title="Geometry Collection" anchor="geometry-collection" toc="default"><t>A GeoJSON object with type "GeometryCollection" is a geometry object which represents a collection of geometry objects.  </t><t>A geometry collection MUST have a member with the name "geometries". The value corresponding to "geometries" is an array. Each element in this array is a GeoJSON geometry object.  </t></section></section><section title="Feature Object" anchor="feature-object" toc="default"><t>A GeoJSON object with the type "Feature" is a feature object.  </t><t><list style="symbols"><t>A feature object MUST have a member with the name "geometry". The value of the geometry member is a geometry object as defined above or a JSON null value.  </t><t>A feature object MUST have a member with the name "properties". The value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).  </t><t>If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be included as a member of the feature object with the name "id".  </t></list></t></section><section title="Feature Collection Object" anchor="feature-collection-object" toc="default"><t>A GeoJSON object with the type "FeatureCollection" is a feature collection object.  </t><t>An object of type "FeatureCollection" MUST have a member with the name "features". The value corresponding to "features" is an array. Each element in the array is a feature object as defined above.  </t></section></section><section title="Bounding Box" anchor="bounding-box" toc="default"><t>A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include information on the coordinate range for geometries, features, or feature collections. The value of the bbox member MUST be an array of length 2*n where n is the number of dimensions represented in the contained geometries, with the lowest values for all axes followed by the highest values. The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries. In addition, the coordinate reference system for the bbox is assumed to match the coordinate reference system of the GeoJSON object of which it is a member.  </t><t>Example of a bbox member on a feature: </t><figure title="" suppress-title="false" align="left" alt="" width="" height=""><artwork xml:space="preserve" name="" type="" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">
